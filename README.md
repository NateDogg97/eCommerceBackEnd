  ## Description

  This project is a basic version of a eComerce Website's back-end code using sequelize and express.js. The motivation for this project was to learn about using sequelize and become more familiar with how real-world websites work. I built this project with some starter code and lots of reading the docs. I used insomnia to check my code. This project doesn't really solve any problem as it is a pretty basic version of the real thing, but it was great practice. I learned the basics of how to connect inputs from a user to be processed in the back-end and stored in a database using sequalize.

  A video demonstration of the project can be found here:

  ## Installation

  To install this program clone the repo on your local machine and run 'npm i' to install the dependencies. Next, create the database with 'mysql -p' then enter your MySQL password. You may need to login in to Sequel first on a browser. Enter 'source db/schema.sql' to create the database followed by 'quit'.

  ## Usage

  To use the application, you must first seed the database with 'npm run seed #'. Now you're ready to start the application with 'npm start'. You can play around with the functionality any way you prefer. I used Insomnia to test this.

  ## Contributing

  If you'd like to contribute to the project, feel free to install it and change it however you'd like. No need to make pull request to merge to main. You are welcome to create new branches for your personal use.

  ## Tests

  To test the application just play around with it in Insomnia. I did not add any testing code such as Jest as this was simply to practice using sequelize.
